Vimthusiast and very much into making videogames.

I've recently made a fun C++ app to make and navigate 3D maps. It's called **Ray**. Look how cute its mascotte is!

You should definitely check it out!

I've also made a puzzle game in C, called **Matter of Time**. Here's its mascotte:

Ok, ok, not equally good looking, but I promise you the game is good!
